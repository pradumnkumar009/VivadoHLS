Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is one of the major experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), CERN. I am working for the CMS Phase II Trigger Upgrade, on the Missing Transverse Energy (MET) problem.
I work with the team at University of Wisconsin, Madison. Currently I am coding for the algorithm for MET calulation using Vivado HLS tools for Xilinx FPGAs.
